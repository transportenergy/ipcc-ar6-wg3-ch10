fig_1:
  short title: Direct transport CO₂ emissions — {{group}}
  normalized version: true
  variables:
  - Emissions|CO2|Energy|Demand|Transportation
  aspect ratio: 0.75
  caption: |
    IAM results are grouped by temperature targets.
    Sectoral studies are grouped by baseline and policy categories because they don’t track global emissions so cannot solve for achieving temperature targets.
    Numbers above the bars indicate the number of scenarios.

    Sources: IAMs —IPCC WGIII AR6 Scenario Database (Annex II.10).
    Sectoral models: MoMo (IEA), EPPA5 (MIT), Roadmap (ICCT), GCAM (PNNL), and MESSAGE (IIASA).
    The policy scenarios in global transport models (GTMs) cover a wide range of “non-BAU” scenarios (to be defined) that are not necessarily designed to achieve the targets set in the Paris Agreements.
